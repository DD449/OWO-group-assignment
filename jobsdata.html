<!-- Personality Traits -->
									<h3 class="major">Personality Profiles</h3>
									<p>Within ‘Team owo’, there seems to be different personalities, some that may clash and some that are very similar, if not identical to other members in the group. Someone like Karanvir who is very assertive and forward with how he wants things done may not seem to work well with someone like Eric who has the test result as someone who may be more of a leader and usually the more vocal one. <br><br>
										However, there are similarities between Jacob, Ghania and Danny. They all want to do what is best for the team and team members. They don’t want others to feel left out or put down and will generally look to ensure everyone is feeling well and comfortable in the team. It also seems that Eric, Jacob, Ghania and Danny are all good team players and don’t have too many issues working with other members. <br><br>
										Overall, the team seems like they can work well together, and everyone wants what’s best for the team. Each member’s personality trait has something that can be utilised in creating a great assignment.

<!-- Industry Data Section -->
									<h3 class="major">Industry Data</h3>
									<caption style="text-align:center"><a style="color:white">What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</caption></a>
									<br></br>
									<p> When considering ranking our ideal jobs in terms of demand we first must establish the outlier of Ghania’s
									job being outside of IT.
								    Because of this we consulted National Skills Commission Australian Jobs published in 2020.
									</p>
                                        <img src="images/accountant1.png" alt="Accountants No.1 Job in sector" style="width:600px; height:150px" class="Accountant1img">
                                    <br></br>

									<p> According to this report Accountants are the most in demand in our sector of this report being clustered as
									Professional, Scientific and Technical Services. As a result, Ghania’s job ranks highest in terms of demand as
									in Australia no.1 job in Professional, Scientific and Technical Services is an Accountant.
									(National Skills Commission Australian Jobs 2020, pg. 7) </p>
									<br></br>
									<p>As for Danny, Eric, Karanvir and Jacob. First we look (Australian Government Career Pathfinder) so we can rank accordingly.</p>
									<img src="images/example.png" alt="Career Pathfinder Example" style="width:828px; height:353px" class="Exampleimg">
									<br></br>
                                    <img src="images/Jobrankingtable.png" alt="Job Ranking" style="width:616px; height:788px" class="Jobrankimg">
									<br></br>
									<br></br>
									<p>In an Australian Government capacity each of our ideal jobs are in the Top 20 of IT in terms of job demands.</p>
									<p>Rankings after establishing this would be:</p>
									<p>1 – Ghania</p>
									<p>2 – Karanvir</p>
									<p>3 – Eric</p>
									<p>4 – Jacob</p>
									<p>5 – Danny</p>
									<p>The rankings are further confirmed when looking at this graph</p>
									<img src="images/Jobgrowth.png" alt="Job Growth" style="width:602px; height:349px" class="Jobgrowthimg">
									<br></br>
									<p>Previously cybersecurity had a boom of job demand. According to the Bureau of Statistics, the rate of growth
									for jobs in information security (Proactive Security) is projected at 37% from 2012–2022—that’s much faster than
									the average for all other occupations. (Bureau of Labor Statistics) so it is still ahead of IT Automation on the
									graph as there is still jobs needing to be filled but Burning Glass Technologies predicts IT Automation to grow
									59% over the next 5 years (Louis Columbus, Top 10 Tech Job Skills Predicted to Grow The Fastest in 2021, Dec. 2020).
									As a result Penetration Tester is still ranked above a Robotic Process Automation Developer. A cyber security
									specialist is a role that requires further experience so naturally there are less openings. Parallel Computing is
									probably most closely related to Danny’s ideal job and as you can see there is still decent demand in this.

                                                                        <h3 class="major"> How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h3>
                                                                        <p> When we view the table we can see the number 1 general required skill is to be able to communicate/ interact with people like clients, users, management and developers. You must have good communication skills because exchanging of information is required for a job. Everyone on the team has a share of communication as there basic skills therefor the ranking of communication is a very demanding skill. </p>
                                                                        <p> The ability to cope under pressure and challenges can come in different forms of skills such as time management, planning and meeting deadlines although these skills sit at a medium rank it does suggest that these skills arent very demanding but because these skills add up into 1 skill for coping under pressure and challenges it averages around rank 16. The team has to have a strong work ethic when under pressure because then they will perform the job poorly and cause issues in the long run. Employers perhaps can look for people who can work under pressure because people who are under pressure just work as poorly as somebody who is inexperienced. </p>
                                                                        <p> Problem solving is a high key skill because when we hit obstacles , we need to overcome them. Without overcoming them we will never be able to solve issues/problems, It is ranked 8 on the table because employers look for people who can fix problems in the business because the responsibility would consistently be put onto the managers if an issue always occurs but if an employee takes care of it then it puts the business less pressured. </p>
                                                                        <p> Self Motivated, being a healthy employee leads to a healthy work environment because self motivation can drive us to do things and push ourselves to fulfill goals. This isn’t on the list for our shared base skills but employers do look for hard workers. </p>

                                                                        <h3 class="major"> What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3>
