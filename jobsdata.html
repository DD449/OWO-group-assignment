<!-- Personality Traits -->
									<h3 class="major">Personality Profiles</h3>
									<p>Within ‘Team owo’, there seems to be different personalities, some that may clash and some that are very similar, if not identical to other members in the group. Someone like Karanvir who is very assertive and forward with how he wants things done may not seem to work well with someone like Eric who has the test result as someone who may be more of a leader and usually the more vocal one. <br><br>
										However, there are similarities between Jacob, Ghania and Danny. They all want to do what is best for the team and team members. They don’t want others to feel left out or put down and will generally look to ensure everyone is feeling well and comfortable in the team. It also seems that Eric, Jacob, Ghania and Danny are all good team players and don’t have too many issues working with other members. <br><br>
										Overall, the team seems like they can work well together, and everyone wants what’s best for the team. Each member’s personality trait has something that can be utilised in creating a great assignment.

<!-- Industry Data Section -->
									<h3 class="major">Industry Data</h3>
									<caption style="text-align:center"><a style="color:white">What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</caption></a>
									<br></br>
									<p> When considering ranking our ideal jobs in terms of demand we first must establish the outlier of Ghania’s
									job being outside of IT.
								    Because of this we consulted National Skills Commission Australian Jobs published in 2020.
									</p>
                                        <img src="images/accountant1.png" alt="Accountants No.1 Job in sector" style="width:600px; height:150px" class="Accountant1img">
                                    <br></br>

									<p> According to this report Accountants are the most in demand in our sector of this report being clustered as
									Professional, Scientific and Technical Services. As a result, Ghania’s job ranks highest in terms of demand as
									in Australia no.1 job in Professional, Scientific and Technical Services is an Accountant.
									(National Skills Commission Australian Jobs 2020, pg. 7) </p>
									<br></br>
									<p>As for Danny, Eric, Karanvir and Jacob. First we look (Australian Government Career Pathfinder) so we can rank accordingly.</p>
									<img src="images/example.png" alt="Career Pathfinder Example" style="width:828px; height:353px" class="Exampleimg">
									<br></br>
                                    <img src="images/Jobrankingtable.png" alt="Job Ranking" style="width:616px; height:788px" class="Jobrankimg">
									<br></br>
									<br></br>
									<p>In an Australian Government capacity each of our ideal jobs are in the Top 20 of IT in terms of job demands.</p>
									<p>Rankings after establishing this would be:</p>
									<p>1 – Ghania</p>
									<p>2 – Karanvir</p>
									<p>3 – Eric</p>
									<p>4 – Jacob</p>
									<p>5 – Danny</p>
									<p>The rankings are further confirmed when looking at this graph</p>
									<img src="images/Jobgrowth.png" alt="Job Growth" style="width:602px; height:349px" class="Jobgrowthimg">
									<br></br>
									<p>Previously cybersecurity had a boom of job demand. According to the Bureau of Statistics, the rate of growth
									for jobs in information security (Proactive Security) is projected at 37% from 2012–2022—that’s much faster than
									the average for all other occupations. (Bureau of Labor Statistics) so it is still ahead of IT Automation on the
									graph as there is still jobs needing to be filled but Burning Glass Technologies predicts IT Automation to grow
									59% over the next 5 years (Louis Columbus, Top 10 Tech Job Skills Predicted to Grow The Fastest in 2021, Dec. 2020).
									As a result Penetration Tester is still ranked above a Robotic Process Automation Developer. A cyber security
									specialist is a role that requires further experience so naturally there are less openings. Parallel Computing is
									probably most closely related to Danny’s ideal job and as you can see there is still decent demand in this.
